As deep learning models evolve, they become increasingly complex and require substantial computational resources, with parameters expanding from billions to trillions. Developing large-scale models involves managing and processing an immense number of parameters, which is very challenging and time-consuming.

The MoAI Platform's automatic parallelization addresses these challenges by simultaneously processing multiple tasks, determining the optimal calculation method for large models. This allows users to focus solely on their core AI challenges, regardless of their application scale or processor type. Furthermore, it efficiently utilizes GPU computational resources at a reasonable cost by allocating them only during calculation execution.
