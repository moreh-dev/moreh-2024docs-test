# 5. Changing the Number of GPUs

Let's rerun the fine-tuning task with a different number of GPUs. MoAI Platform abstracts GPU resources into a single accelerator and automatically performs parallel processing. Therefore, there is no need to modify the PyTorch script even when changing the number of GPUs.

## Changing the Accelerator type

Switch the accelerator type using the **`moreh-switch-model`** tool. For instructions on changing the accelerator, please refer to the [3. Model fine-tuning](3_fine_tuning.md) 

```bash
$ moreh-switch-model
```

Please contact your infrastructure provider and choose one of the following options before proceeding. [(HAC) AI Accelerator Information](/Supported_Documents/KT_HAC_Models_Info.md)

- AMD MI250 GPU with 32 units
    - When using Moreh's trial container: select [!badge variant="secondary" text=8xlarge] 
    - When using KT Cloud's Hyperscale AI Computing: select [!badge variant="secondary" text=8xLarge.4096GB]
- AMD MI210 GPU with 64 units
- AMD MI300X GPU with 16 units



## Training Parameters

Run the `train_mistral.py` script again without changing the batch size.

```bash
~/moreh-quickstart$ python tutorial/train_mistral.py
```

If the training proceeds normally, you should see the following logs:

```

Compared to the previous execution results when the number of GPUs was half, you can see that the learning is the same and the throughput has improved. 

- When using AMD MI250 GPU 16 → 32 : approximately 60,000 tokens/sec → 110,000 tokens/sec
