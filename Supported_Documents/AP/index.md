# Advanced Parallelization(AP)

### What is Advanced Parallelization?

Advanced Parallelization (AP) is an optimized automated distributed parallel processing feature provided by the MoAI Platform. Typically, ML engineers go through numerous trial-and-error processes to optimize model parallelization when training large models. This involves considering the memory size of the GPUs being used, directly applying various parallelization techniques, and measuring the performance of different combinations of options within each technique to determine the optimal configuration.

However, with the AP feature offered by the MoAI Platform, you can easily apply optimized parallelization techniques, significantly reducing the time and effort required before starting the training process.
