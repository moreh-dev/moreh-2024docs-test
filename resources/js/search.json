You can run it in a conda environment where MoAI Platform PyTorch is installed.","If you are currently running training using the MoAI Accelerator, executing moreh-smi in a separate terminal session will display information about the running processes. Additionally, by using moreh-smi, you can quickly identify your Job ID. If you encounter any issues during training or inference on the MoAI Platform, providing your Job ID when contacting customer support will facilitate a faster response."]},{"l":"Utilizing Multi-Accelerator Feature","p":["By default, if users do not make any additional settings, there will be only one MoAI Accelerator in a single SSH environment. Typically, with one MoAI Accelerator, only one process can be executed at a time, allowing for only one process to run in a single SSH environment.","However, there may be scenarios where users want to leverage multiple MoAI Accelerators within the same SSH environment to run multiple processes simultaneously (e.g., running multiple training experiments concurrently with the same source code but different hyperparameters). In such cases, using moreh-smi to create multiple MoAI Accelerators within a single token enables running multiple processes concurrently.","Let's go through an example of adding, changing, and removing AI accelerators."]},{"l":"Adding AI Accelerators","p":["First, let's add an AI accelerator. To use two or more AI accelerators, you can enter the moreh-smi device --add command, which will display the following interface.","Enter an integer corresponding to the model you want to use from 1 to 13, and a message \"Create device success.\" will appear, indicating that the AI accelerator corresponding to the entered device number has been created. Up to 5 AI accelerators can be created within a single VM.","In the example below, let's add the AI accelerator with model number 10."]},{"l":"Changing Default AI Accelerator","p":["The moreh-smi device --switch {Device_ID} command allows you to change the default MoAI Accelerator.","Here's how to use it:","You can see that the default MoAI Accelerator has been changed to accelerator #1 in the example above."]},{"l":"Changing AI Accelerators with moreh-switch-model","p":["moreh-switch-model is a tool that allows you to change the flavor (specification) of the currently configured MoAI Accelerator. By changing the flavor of the MoAI Accelerator, you determine how much GPU memory to use.","Here's how to use it:","For example, if the result of the moreh-smi command is as follows, it means \"The currently configured MoAI Accelerator is accelerator 0, and the type of this MoAI Accelerator is the Small.64GB model.\"","When you use the moreh-switch-model command, an input prompt will appear like below:","Enter an integer (device number) corresponding to the model you want to use from 1 to 13, and the MoAI Accelerator will be switched to the MoAI Accelerator corresponding to the entered device number with the message \"The MoAI Platform AI Accelerator model is successfully switched to .\"","Let's change the MoAI Accelerator to the model with device number 3.","You can continue the change or exit the MoAI Accelerator change by entering q or Q.","After the change is complete, when you use moreh-smi again to check, the result will be as follows:","You can see that the MoAI Accelerator type has been changed from the model to the model."]},{"l":"Removing AI Accelerators","p":["Next, let's try deleting the accelerator corresponding to a specific device ID using the command moreh-smi device --rm {Device_ID}.","By entering the command above, the AI accelerator with Device ID 1 has been deleted.

In this case, you can easily install the latest version of Moreh solutions using the update-moreh command.","If you want to use the latest version of Moreh solutions in an already installed conda environment, you can update the currently installed Moreh solutions to the latest version using the update-moreh command alone.","Sometimes, you may need to install a specific version of Moreh solutions. In this case, you can use the --target option to specify the specific version you want to install.","If MoAI Platform does not work properly due to dependency conflicts between different packages in the conda environment, you might have to reinstall the conda environment. In such cases, you can use update-moreh to restore the Moreh solutions in the conda environment. In the latter case, you can use the --force option to rebuild the environment.
